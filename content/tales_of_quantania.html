Once upon a time, there existed a mythical land called Quantania. 

Most mortals like us had not even heard about it. But legends said that Bizarre, unheard of events took place frequently in this land. Unimaginable, unthinkable feats like Telepathy and Teleportation happened on a mattter of factly basis.

Everything about Quantania was a puzzle. A mystery.

For example, after reading this page, you might be thinking that Quantania was in the past. But no, in reality...it is in the near future.

And you are inevitably heading towards it...getting closer with each breath...


# Introduction

Hi,

My name is Tushar. I am a software engineer during the day and a time traveller at night.

Yeah, I know what you are thinking.

“Lol! How can someone be a software engineer”.

So I won’t talk about that part.

Let me share one of my experiences as a time-traveller.

All of us travel in time at +1 second per second. 

But it takes special skills and courage to break the time barrier. I realized I could time travel when I would go to sleep at night and wake up next morning...only to realize that I had travelled 8 hours forward in time through darkness...just in a snap!

Sometimes, while I was travelling this way during the night, instead of darkness, I would come across distant worlds, new characters where a story would unfold. When I would wake up, I would decipher what had happened.

One such travel was to a land called Quantania... 


# A mysterious land

The people of Quantania were called ‘Qubits’. They were jolly, full of life but not easy to understand as they had peculiar traits.

However, in their defence, the Qubits might say that they were a highly advanced civilization. They were natural telepaths. Their view was that it was the people of outside land like us mortals who relied on verbal communication and had a diifficulty in comprehending them.

Still, mortals like us would call them moody, not easy to figure out till they opened their mouths.

For example, if you were to announce to a young pretty Qubit lady:

“Tea ready!”

You would see that she has heard you and, started considering having the tea you made...and has made up her mind. Qubits would call this process they follow while deciding upon anything from tea to marriage proposal as ‘Quantum Initialization’.

However, you may get perplexed looking at that Qubit lady’s Mon Lisa like enigmatic smile wondering whether her answer is a yes or a no. You may think she is a snob just because she is so pretty.

The Qubits called this state of mind their ‘Quantum state’.

If you were to ask a wise old Qubit man about the lady, he would assure you that though the onlooker can not read the lady’s well-guarded mind, it does not mean that the lady hasn’t made up her decision about the tea. In fact she definitely knows whether she wants to have tea or not but is waiting for etiquettes to be followed and you to ask the specific question:

“Would you like tea, madam?”

This, the Qubits called as ‘Measurement’ of their ‘Quantum state’, i.e. mind, where they finally gave in to the request of us mortals and gave a reply in verbatim. However, for such telepathic individuals, their usage of language was mostly minimalistic, almost always restricted to a yes or no.

And so, the pretty Qubit lady replied with a smile:

Climate-wise, Qubits preffered winter and extreme cold which made them calmer. They did not like summer as the heat made them ‘noisy’ and confused.
